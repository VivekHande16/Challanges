# Challange 3

## Problem statement

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get
back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
value = d
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a

## Approach

I am using javascript to solve this problem.

Its fairly simple in javascript to play with json/object data.

I am using npm jest package to building test cases.

Approch is explained in script.js file.
